## About Me💻:
I am extremely passionate about developing performant🚀, user-focused UIs 😍 web applications with the best and latest technology.

I love❤️️ working with ReactJS⚛️, HTML, CSS and JavaScript but I also spend most of the time exploring the latest technologies like NodeJS, GatsbyJS, NextJS, GraphQL. I also worked with PHP, WordPress Theme/Plugin development.

## Personally:
 I'm very fond of music🎼 of various genres. Apart from that the mountains are my favorite terrain, and I live in the ⛰Pune(IN) city which becomes hill station in rainy season due to an extensive mountain range. Rainy season turns the entire dry lands into beautiful nature landscapes.

## Staying fit🏋:
Staying fit is important for good health, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is the key to staying fit. I start my day with a workout. I'm the kind of person who really loves most exercise, but 🚶walking my favorite.
